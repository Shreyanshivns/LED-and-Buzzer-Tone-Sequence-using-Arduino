# ðŸŽµ LED and Buzzer Tone Sequence using Arduino

This Arduino project lights up three LEDs sequentially while playing different tones from a buzzer for each LED. It demonstrates the use of digital pins, basic timing with `delay()`, and sound generation with the `tone()` function.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

- **Language**: C++
- **Platform**: Arduino (Tinkercad compatible)
- **Components Used**:
  - Arduino Uno
  - 3 LEDs
  - 3 Resistors (220Î©)
  - 1 Buzzer
  - Jumper Wires
  - Breadboard

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Each LED (on pins 8, 7, and 6) lights up one after the other.
- When an LED is turned ON, the buzzer (on pin 9) plays a specific tone corresponding to that LED.
  - LED1: 750 Hz
  - LED2: 950 Hz
  - LED3: 1150 Hz
- Each LED-buzzer pair is active for 200 milliseconds before moving to the next.
