# LED-and-Buzzer-Tone-Sequence-using-Arduino
This Arduino project lights up three LEDs in sequence, each paired with a unique buzzer tone (750 Hz, 950 Hz, 1150 Hz). It uses digital pins 6â€“9 and loops continuously. Ideal for beginners to learn LED control, sound generation with tone(), and basic Arduino logic. Simulatable on Tinkercad.
